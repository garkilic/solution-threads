ON LEAVING OAXACA
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Grandpa José remembers the day the letter arrived from Uncle Ernesto. He was 15. His father Roberto read it twice before saying anything. His mother Consuelo didn't speak at dinner. Two weeks later, they told the children they were leaving. He says he looked back at the mountains from the road the whole time the truck drove away. He thought he was never going to see them again.

He brought one thing: a small carved jaguar his grandfather had given him. He still keeps it on his desk.

When they left, Consuelo packed her metate stone. José says the truck driver laughed at her for bringing a heavy stone across the border, but she would not leave it. She used that same stone to grind corn in Fresno until she died.

ON ARRIVING IN CALIFORNIA
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Uncle Ernesto met them at the Greyhound station in Fresno. He was wearing a baseball cap and a jacket José didn't recognize — not Mexican, not American, just different. He looked older.

The first thing that confused José about California was the supermarket. He'd never seen food under that much light, that still, that quiet. In Oaxaca the market had noise and smell and chickens. The Safeway felt like a museum.

He started school two weeks after arriving. He understood nothing. He memorized faces instead of words. He says the worst part was lunch — not knowing what to eat, not knowing the words to ask for things. He ate the same thing every day for three months: whatever Rosa pointed at.

ON KEEPING TRADITIONS ALIVE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The tamale tradition: Every Christmas Eve, the whole family makes tamales together. It takes all day and begins the night before with soaking the corn husks. Grandma Maria is in charge. Everyone has a job. Rosa spreads the masa. Daniel folds. Elena used to steal olives from the pot when she was small. They make about 200. Some go to neighbors.

Grandma Maria says: "The tamales are not about the food. They are about the eight hours where everyone is in the same room."

José Sr. kept the weaving alive in a different way. He doesn't weave himself — he never had the loom — but he hung his father Roberto's tapete on the living room wall the day they moved into the house on Van Ness Avenue in 1989. It has hung there since. When Rosa's daughter asked what it was, he said: "That's our family talking."

Spanish was always the language of the home. The children grew up switching — English at school, Spanish at home. Maria learned English from Sesame Street and from helping Rosa with homework. She says Big Bird taught her what the word "beside" meant and she never forgot it.


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ON THE TRIP BACK TO OAXACA (1998)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

José Sr. hadn't been back in 24 years. He cried at the airport in Oaxaca City — not at arrivals, but at the gate, before they even got off the plane. He didn't tell the kids why.

Rosa remembers it as the trip where she understood for the first time that her father had been a child somewhere. That he had played in those streets. She says she kept looking at him looking at things.

Elena (age 11) spoke almost no Spanish at that point but came home three weeks later speaking full sentences. Nobody knows how. She says the cousins didn't give her a choice.

They visited Roberto Sr.'s old workshop, which was now a cousin's house. The loom was gone but the cousin's family still wove. They gave José a small tapete with the same pattern his father used to make — the jaguar-and-mountain border. It now hangs next to the original in the living room.

José says the hardest part of the trip was leaving again. He understood, the second time, that it was permanent.

QUOTES — IN THEIR OWN WORDS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

José Sr.: "My father said every pattern in a tapete is a word, and every rug is a whole story. I think about that a lot now. I think our family is a story like that — you have to see the whole thing to understand what any one part means."

Maria: "We came here with two suitcases and one dream. The dream was just: let the children have more choices than we had. That's all. Not money. Not a big house. Just choices."

José Sr. (on the mountains): "You never stop seeing them. Even here, in Fresno, I see them. Not with my eyes. But I see them."

Rosa: "I didn't know my father had a whole life before me. Whole streets he played on. A whole language of things. The trip to Oaxaca was the first time I understood him as a person, not just my dad."

Daniel: "Every family has a book in them. Most families never write it. We're writing ours."

FAMILY DETAILS FOR THE BOOK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Art style preference: warm, painterly, like old Mexican children's books — think Diego Rivera murals but softer
- Key objects to include: the metate stone, the jaguar carving, Roberto's tapete rug, Ernesto's baseball cap, the Greyhound station, the mango tree in Oaxaca
- Sounds of home: the metate grinding in the morning, Grandma Consuelo calling José's name, the market on Wednesdays
- Smells: corn masa, wood smoke, Oaxacan chocolate, and in California — the eucalyptus trees on the way to school
- The family gathers every Christmas Eve. That scene should be in the book.
