Subject: RE: Clean Energy Policy Impact
Date: February 6, 2026
From: Margaret Whitfield <m.whitfield@whitfieldfamily.com>
To: Maria Egan <megan@reyndersmcveigh.com>

Maria,

Thank you for the thoughtful analysis on the clean energy holdings.
Very helpful and reassuring. I'm looking forward to discussing the
allocation proposal at our meeting next week. Sarah will join by
video as well — she's been following the clean energy space closely.

One more thing — I'd like to briefly discuss the gifting strategy
for the grandchildren that we mentioned in January. Paul Delaney
said he can make himself available by phone during our meeting if
needed. Let me know if that works.

See you Tuesday!
Margaret
